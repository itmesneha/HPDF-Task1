# HPDF_internship_task1

Task 1 includes front-end pages (home page and search page) using Twitter as reference for functionality.

# Basic Information

This is built with npm (Node Package Manager) as it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; and it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. So download Node.js first. It is also built using components from material-ui. Also I have used the basic create-react-app as the starting point. I have included google material-icons,flexgrid and the Roboto font in my html (index.html) and css (App.css) files.

Also this works best in recent versions of Google Chrome browser.

# Usage

To run this on your system download the zip folder and extract all files. There are 2 folders one for search page and one for home page. Navigate to one of them in your command line and run "npm install" this should take care of all required dependencies and node modules, then run "npm start" and you should see the page up and running in your default browser. I have included the flexboxgrid in node modules as that doesn't get installed automatically. I have downloaded and tested the repository on my own chrome browser as well.
