Task 1 includes front-end pages (home page and search page) using Twitter as reference for functionality.

Requirements

This is built with npm (Node Package Manager) as it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; and it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. So download Node.js first. It is also built using components from material-ui so install that like this npm install --save material-ui Also I have used the basic create-react-app as the starting point. This should include all the node modules required. I have included google material-icons,flexgrid and the Roboto font in my html (index.html) and css (App.css) files.

Also this works best in recent versions of Google Chrome browser.
